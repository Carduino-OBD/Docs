# Carduino Docs

Carduino is a suite of software that allows users to track drives and interact with their vehicle using the OBD-II port over Bluetooth. Currently, the app runs on iOS devices running iOS 14 or newer. The firmware runs on the Freematics ONE+ Model B.

## Car Compatibility
In theory, any car manufactured since 1996 should work. However, your mileage may vary. This list is not definitive and is only from past user experiences. A vehicle not being listed only means it has not been tested. The firmware may change in ways that may make it compatible with your car, or break compatibility. Feel free to contribute your own findings, or improvements for cars that are listed as uncompatible here.

### Compatible
- Acura
  - TLX
    - 2018-2020
  - MDX
    - 2022
### Incompatible
- Acura
  - MDX
    - 2014 (Technology package tested, plugging the device in immediately causes the vehicle to throw error codes for LDW and FCW. 2015 is also most likely affected. The Advance model likely suffers from similar issues, but the base model is most likely fine. May also occur on similar model year RDX, ILX, RLX, and TLX)
